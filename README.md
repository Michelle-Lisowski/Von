This is a rewrite of Von, with a couple of the main focuses
being code efficiency and performance.

It's almost finished, so I recommend using the code from this branch for self-hosting.

If you wish to contribute, you can. Just fork and pull.

## Development Status

Next focus: Permission checks, voting in 'skip' and 'clear' commands, and documentation.
