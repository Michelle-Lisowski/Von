This is a rewrite of Von, with a couple of the main focuses
being code efficiency and performance.

~~It's almost finished, so I recommend using the code from this branch for self-hosting.~~
It's complete. This code will soon be moved to the `master` branch as well, while the future
third version will be in a reset `development` branch.

## Development

Next focus: Version 3.
