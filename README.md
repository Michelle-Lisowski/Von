This is a rewrite of Von, with a couple of the main focuses
being code efficiency and performance.

It's almost finished, so I recommend using the code from this branch for self-hosting.

If you wish to contribute, you can. Just fork and pull.

## Development Status

Next focus: Command-specific help, command cooldowns, voting in 'clear' command,
more customisable behaviour, and documentation.
