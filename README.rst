This is an in-progress rewrite of Von, with a couple of the main focuses
being code efficiency and performance.

Please go to either the `master <https://github.com/sirtezza451/Von/tree/master>`_
or `development <https://github.com/sirtezza451/Von/tree/development>`__ branches,
unless you're going to contribute or you want an unfinished bot.

You can contribute by forking this repository, pushing commits, and submitting
a pull request.

Development Status
------------------

Next focus: Permission checks, voting in 'skip' and 'clear' commands, and documentation.
