This is an in-progress rewrite of Von, with a couple of the main focuses
being code efficiency and performance.

I recommend avoiding this branch for running your own instance of Von,
unless you wish to contribute to development. If so, make sure to keep track
of the development status shown below.

You can contribute by forking this repository, pushing commits, and submitting
a pull request.

Development Status
------------------

Next focus: better detail in info-based commands, such as ``v!info``,
``v!profile`` and ``v!serverinfo``.
