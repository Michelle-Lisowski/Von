This is an in-progress rewrite of Von, with one of the main focuses being
code efficiency.

I recommend avoiding this branch for running your own instance, unless you
wish to fork and pull. Contribution is not needed, but I certainly wouldn't
decline it. Currently, only the basic framework has been completed; help and
owner commands, and bot initialisation.

General commands such as ``v!profile`` and ``v!serverinfo`` are going to be
worked on next.
